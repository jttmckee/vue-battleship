# vue-battleship

This is an [Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) [assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/javascript).

The idea is to practise testing javascript.  I've chosen to do it with Vue (and the Jest test runner).  It was a bit difficult to set up so feel free to copy the config files!
